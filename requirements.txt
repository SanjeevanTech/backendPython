# Bus Passenger Tracking System - Python Dependencies

# Core dependencies
pymongo==4.6.0              # MongoDB driver
numpy==1.24.3               # Numerical operations for face embeddings
scikit-learn==1.3.2         # Cosine similarity calculations
requests==2.31.0            # HTTP requests for distance APIs
python-dateutil==2.8.2      # Date/time utilities

# Face recognition library (OPTIONAL - for local development only)
# Uncomment these for local face recognition testing:
# face-recognition==1.3.0   # Simple face recognition library
# dlib==19.24.0             # Required by face-recognition

# NOTE: Production deployment doesn't need face-recognition libraries
# because face recognition is handled by ESP32 devices
